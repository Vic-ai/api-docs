  description: |
    Vic.Api allows you to connect an *ERP* to the Vic.ai product suite.
    The API is structured to provide 3 categories of functionality:
    - **Masterdata:** Masterdata are data in the ERP that Vic.ai interacts with.
      So you must provide and update this masterdata in Vic.ai, and you may also
      verify the masterdata copy in Vic.ai
    - **Training Data:** AI requires historical data to train its data model. So
      you can put historical invoices into Vic.ai to train it, and verify that
      they are in Vic.ai.
    - **Webhooks:** Users or automated tasks could take various actions in the
      Vic.ai product suite that result in an interaction with the ERP (for
      example, posting an invoice, or requesting synchronization). We'll tell
      you when such an action has occurred, via a webhook.

      specific payment term. In either case, Vic.ai can automatically assign
      payment terms to invoices.

        Use this request to indicate that an invoice has been posted or
        transferred to the ERP system, in the case where you have not activated
        a subscription, or you have responded to the subscription with a
        202-asynchronous response.
        Note that this operation can either be a confirmation, or a rejection,
        depending on the shape of the payload.
        Possible payloads:
        - InvoiceConfirm: used to confirm that the invoice data have been
          successfully posted to the ERP, possibly including a postingError.
          - Use of this postingError means that the invoice data are posted, but
            some secondary content needs amendation in the ERP that cannot be
            performed from the vic user interface (for example: a problem
            uploading the posted document).
        - InvoiceReject: used to communicate that the invoice data have NOT been
          successfully posted to the ERP, due to invalid data. This should NOT
          be used to communicate an error in posting due to a general failure
          such as a network issue or an availability issue with the ERP, in
          those or similar cases, a retry should be performed without notifying the vic system.
        Currently unsupported:
        - InvoiceClearError: the error set in an `InvoiceConfirm` operation
          should be cleared because the postingError has been resolved in the
          ERP. This cannot be used to clear an error due to `InvoiceReject`.
        Note that `:id` *must* be internalId for this route.

                This request is sent when a user in Vic.ai adds a new vendor to
                the system.
                Request body contains the vendor object.
                A 201 response indicates that the vendor object has been
                successfully persisted to the ERP, and it must contain the ERP's
                vendor object id as the externalId parameter.
                Any other response will be considered a failure, the vendor
                object `externalId` will not be specified, and the error message
                you specify will be surfaced to the user.
                A 400 response indicates a data validation error.
                This callback will timeout after 5 seconds.

                This request is sent when a user in Vic.ai posts an invoice
                object to the system.
                Request body contains the invoice object (`invoiceData` part) as
                JSON, and corresponding invoice documents as a pdf file
                (`invoicePayload` part) as multipart form data. This will always
                be a pdf file.
                A 201 response indicates that the invoice object has been
                successfully persisted to the ERP, and it must contain the ERP's
                invoice object id as the `externalId` parameter.
                A 202 response indicates that the receipt of the invoice object
                has been acknowledged; an asynchronous update will occur via
                `invoiceConfirm` and the supplied 'X-Request-Id' in the request
                header will be provided as the `X-Request-Id` header for any
                associated asynchronous updates.
                Any other response will be considered a failure, the invoice
                object `externalId` will not be specified, and the error message
                you specify will be surfaced to the user.
                A 400 response indicates a data validation error.
                This callback will timeout after 5 seconds; to prevent
                inconsistencies, if the request will take longer than 5 seconds,
                it is appropriate to respond with a 202 response code.
